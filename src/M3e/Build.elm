module M3e.Build exposing
    ( Builder
    , toElement
    )

{-| The shared builder surface for the `M3e` brand: the opaque `Builder`
and the single `toElement` that closes any component's builder. Per-component
modules provide the seeds (`build`) and the narrowed `withX` setters; they all
share this one representation, so `toElement` is defined once (in
`M3e.Build.Internal`) and re-exported here.
