{-| The builder forge for the `M3e` brand — the ONE place a `Builder`'s
capability rows are minted and its record constructor is exposed. Every
per-component `build`/`withX`/`toElement` composes these levers; the mechanics
are defined here exactly once. Untrusted code that imports this module can forge
any capability claim, exactly like `HtmlIr.Internal` — the
`NoInternalImportOutsideAllowed` fence is load-bearing.

{-| The shared pipe-builder. `attrCaps`/`slotCaps` are phantom write-once
capability rows; `row` is the host element's closed attribute row; `tag` is the
custom-element tag closed over at `init`. Each component aliases this with its
own `row` and exposes narrowed `withX` setters.
