facts-driven set (which comes from the `jackhp95/elm-review-cem` package). These

{-| The facts both brands contribute, in ladder order.

M3e first is deliberate: when a redundant escape could be replaced by either a
design-system setter or a native one, the M3e suggestion is the one a reader
should see first. That is the same `M3e > TypedHtml > escape` ordering the
`auditing-m3e-escapes` skill enforces by hand.

{-| The M3e-specific project-discipline rules.

**Escape discipline is three layers, not one**, because each catches what the
others structurally cannot:

1.  `NoUnsafeImportOutsideAllowed` — the _import_ fence. One error per module,
    naming no call site. Cheap, and it is the only layer that fires when a module
    has no business holding an escape at all.
2.  `NoRedundantAttributeEscape` / `NoRedundantElementEscape` — the _use_ layer.
    These name the specific call and the typed alternative that already exists,
    which the import fence cannot do, and they stay silent for modules that are
    allow-listed above.
3.  `NoRedundantElementForge` — the _producer_ layer, for a blessed adapter
    re-forging a plain tag `TypedHtml.*` already provides.

This replaces `NoSeamOutsideAllowedModules`, which had been repurposed to fence
`*.Unsafe` after the userland `Seam` module was deleted. That was a wheel already
in the box: `NoUnsafeImportOutsideAllowed` was built for exactly that job, and
running two rules over one boundary is how they drift apart.
