module Shared exposing (Data, Model, Msg, NavComponent, SearchEntry, componentCategories, template)

{-| The M3 application shell that frames every docs route.

Owns the single `<m3e-theme>` for the whole app. Navigation is split across
three surfaces:

  - **Top-level sections** (Start, Guide, Styles, Examples, Components) live
    in a persistent `M3e.NavRail` down the left edge on desktop, swapped for a
    fixed-bottom `M3e.NavBar` on mobile (`docsNavRail`/`docsNavBar`, Tailwind
    `md:` swap at 768px).
  - **The current section's page tree** lives in the `start` slot of an
    `M3e.DrawerContainer` below the app bar (`navMenu`), pinned open on
    desktop and toggled from the app bar's hamburger on narrow screens. It
    shows only the CURRENT section's items (`currentSectionItems`) — the rail
    already says which section you're in, so the tree doesn't repeat it.
  - **The current page's table of contents** auto-discovers the page's
    headings at render time (`M3e.Toc`, in `tocPanel`) and lives in the same
    container's `end` slot, pinned open on wide screens and toggled from the
    app bar's "On this page" button otherwise.

Above them sits a real `M3e.AppBar` top app bar; the live theme controls are in
a settings bottom sheet toggled from it. Every icon goes through `M3e.Icon`;
every action through `M3e.IconButton`; every theme control through
`M3e.SegmentedButton`.

Both drawer panels' open state is genuinely model-owned (`treeOpen`/`tocOpen`)
rather than recomputed per render — see `drawerSideBreakpointPx` for why that
distinction is load-bearing.

The scheme/contrast/direction state is held as generated `Value` tokens — there is
no local shadow union — so `M3e.Theme` takes the model field directly and the
settings controls render from the generated `<enum>Values` lists. Every
constructor is `Module.view [attrs] [content]`.

{-| The width at or above which `DrawerContainer`'s `auto` mode keeps a panel
in `side` (pinned, content-shrinking) rather than `push`/`over` (overlaying,
scrim-dismissable).

**This number is not ours to pick.** It is `Breakpoint.Medium`'s
`(min-width: 960px)` in `@m3e/web/dist/core-layout.js`, which
`_updateMode` in `@m3e/web/dist/drawer-container.js` observes. Elm has to
mirror it because the panels' open state is a Lit property, not CSS state:
Elm decides whether a panel starts pinned open, and the element decides how a
pinned panel is drawn. Elm used to say 768 while the element said 960, and
every width in between was a trap: the element auto-CLOSED the panel and said
so via its `change` event, but Elm's open state was a formula
(`not (isMobile model) || model.showMenu`) that still evaluated to the same
constant `True`, so the virtual-DOM diff emitted no patch and the panel stayed
shut for good — no later tap and no later resize could reopen it.

Hence both halves of the fix: this constant matches the element's, AND the open
state is now a plain model field (`treeOpen`/`tocOpen`) rendered directly, so it
cannot collapse into a constant again.

This is deliberately NOT the Tailwind `md` breakpoint (768px), which
independently controls the `docsNavRail`/`docsNavBar` swap in pure CSS and
needs no Elm state at all.

-}
drawerSideBreakpointPx : Int
drawerSideBreakpointPx =
    960


{-| The width at or above which the TOC panel is ALSO pinned open beside the
tree, instead of being one-at-a-time with it.

Derived from the layout budget rather than from a Material breakpoint: the
rail is fixed `expanded` (`docsNavRail`) at 220px and each drawer panel is
`--m3e-drawer-container-width` = 14rem = 224px (set in `drawerShell`), so both
panels open costs 220 + 224 + 224 = 668px of chrome. At 1200px that still
leaves ~532px of readable content; below it, pinning both would crush the
content pane, so below this width `panelsExclusive` lets only one panel be
open at a time.

-}
tocPinBreakpointPx : Int
tocPinBreakpointPx =
    1200


{-| The width below which the search overlay runs in **fullscreen** mode
instead of **docked**.

Not a layout choice of ours: this is `@m3e/web`'s own `Breakpoint.XSmall`
(`max-width: 599.98px`) restated in Elm, because `searchOverlay` drives
`mode` explicitly rather than letting the element pick — see `searchModeFor`.
Keep it equal to that breakpoint; a mismatch would only mean the overlay
renders in the mode we asked for at a width the element would have chosen
differently, which is harmless but confusing.

-}
searchFullscreenBreakpointPx : Int
searchFullscreenBreakpointPx =
    600


{-| The `mode` to hand `m3e-search-view` at this width.

The element ships a `mode="auto"` that computes exactly this itself, and we
deliberately do NOT use it. `auto` installs an `M3eBreakpointObserver` in
`willUpdate`, and its callback fires ONCE on install with the real match:

    const currentMode = this.currentMode;             // "docked" (the default)
    this._mode = matches.get(Breakpoint.XSmall) ? "fullscreen" : "docked";
    if (currentMode !== this._mode && this.open) {
        this.open = false;                            // no `toggle` event!
    }

Since `searchOverlay` mounts the element already `open`, below 600px that
callback flips `open` back to `false` on the very first render — and it does
so WITHOUT dispatching `toggle`, so `searchToggleDecoder` never fires and
`model.searchOpen` stays `True` forever. The panel never opens, and every
later FAB tap is a no-op (no model change -> no re-render -> the element is
never asked to open again). Passing a non-`auto` mode takes the
`this._mode = undefined; updateMode()` branch instead, which installs no
observer at all, so there is no race to lose.

`model.viewportWidth` is already maintained by the `Browser.Events.onResize`
subscription, so a resize across the breakpoint re-renders with the other
mode — the element's `willUpdate` then closes the overlay on a genuine mode
CHANGE, which does route through `updated`/`toggle` and stays in sync.

-}
searchModeFor : Int -> Value M3e.SearchView.Mode
searchModeFor width =
    if width < searchFullscreenBreakpointPx then
        Value.fullscreen

    else
        Value.docked


{-| Does this route render the docs shell at all?

`/examples/*` pages render bare (`view` short-circuits to `View.body`) so the
example owns the whole viewport. Nothing shell-shaped exists on those routes:
no rail, no bottom bar, no FAB — and no `searchOverlay`, since that is mounted
inside the same branch. `subscriptions` reads this too, so the Cmd/Ctrl+K port
cannot set `searchOpen = True` on a route with nothing to show for it (which
would then pop the overlay open unrequested on the NEXT navigation).

`docs/index.ts` mirrors this prefix check before it calls `preventDefault()`,
so on `/examples/*` the browser keeps its own Cmd/Ctrl+K instead of having it
swallowed for no visible effect.

-}

    not (String.startsWith "/examples/" (UrlPath.toAbsolute path))


{-| Is the page tree pinned open at this width? Also the default it is restored
to on a route change or on growing past the breakpoint.
-}
treePinsOpen : Int -> Bool
treePinsOpen width =
    width >= drawerSideBreakpointPx


{-| Is the TOC pinned open at this width? (Only relevant on a page that opted
into a TOC — `drawerShell` still gates the `end` slot on non-empty entries.)
-}
tocPinsOpen : Int -> Bool
tocPinsOpen width =
    width >= tocPinBreakpointPx


{-| May only ONE of the two panels be open at this width?

Below `drawerSideBreakpointPx` this is forced on us: `DrawerContainer.willUpdate`
force-closes `start` when `end` opens (and vice versa) whenever the other panel
is not in `side` mode — and it does so WITHOUT dispatching a `change` event, so
Elm cannot learn about it after the fact and has to apply the same rule in its
own handlers or its model silently drifts from the element's.

Between `drawerSideBreakpointPx` and `tocPinBreakpointPx` the element would
happily hold both open, but there is not enough room for a readable content
column, so we enforce exclusivity ourselves. Elm being STRICTER than the
element is safe: it closes the other panel in the same update, so the element
never sees the both-open state it would have corrected.

{-| Record a new viewport width, re-pinning each panel to its default when — and
only when — the resize CROSSED that panel's breakpoint.

Crossing-only, rather than recomputing from the width every time, is what keeps
an explicit toggle sticky: a user who closes the pinned tree at 1440px keeps it
closed while nudging the window to 1500px. Crossing back up is what makes the
old "stuck closed forever" failure recoverable at all — the `subscriptions`
comment has always promised this; before, `ViewportResized` only stored the
width.

Both defaults are routed through `setTreeOpen`/`setTocOpen` so that widening
from mobile — where the user may have had the TOC open — into the 960-1199 band
cannot leave both panels open at once.

window to a wide one. Without this the panels the element auto-closed on the way
DOWN would stay closed on the way back up, since nothing else in the app ever
sets `treeOpen` without a deliberate tap.

The Cmd/Ctrl+K port is gated on `hasDocsShell`, because `searchOverlay` is
mounted inside the shell branch of `view`: on an `/examples/*` route the
shortcut would set `searchOpen = True` with nothing rendered to show it, and
the flag would then survive until the next `PageChanged` — popping the overlay
open unrequested on a route the user never asked to search from.

{-| The TOC toggle is always shown. It used to be gated on whether the route
had declared any `View.TocEntry`s, back when a route had to enumerate its own
headings by hand — but `tocPanel` now mounts a single `m3e-toc` that discovers
headings from the real rendered DOM at runtime, so Elm has no advance list to
check emptiness against. The rare page with no qualifying headings just opens
to a near-empty panel rather than hiding the button; that's an honest (if
minor) trade against ever again silently missing a heading, which is exactly
how this button's old gating condition and the old hand-built entry lists
drifted apart.

It used to be gated on viewport width too, because the `end` panel's
visibility was a formula that ignored `tocOpen` on desktop — so the button
would have been a focusable no-op there. Now that `tocOpen` is the single
authority at every width, the button always does something visible: below
`tocPinBreakpointPx` it opens the panel (closing the tree), at or above it
collapses the pinned panel to give the content column its width back.

{-| The settings bottom sheet, opened by the `m3e-bottom-sheet-trigger` nested
in `settingsButton` (the element's own `_onClick` calls `.show()` directly --
no Elm round-trip). `modal` scrims the page and dismisses on an outside click
or Escape (the actual dismiss-outside-listener attach is deferred a frame via
`requestAnimationFrame`, so the SAME click that opened it is never seen as
"outside" -- that race is what an earlier, `onClick`-through-Elm version of
this trigger hit, since Elm's own render round-trip landed unpredictably
relative to that same deferred frame; a native trigger's synchronous
`.show()` call doesn't have that round-trip to race). `handle` + `hideable`
let a swipe-down dismiss it too. The element owns its own open/closed state
entirely -- opening AND closing -- with no Elm involvement at all, not even
to sync a mirrored model field back afterward; the same way `docsNavRail`'s
`m3e-nav-rail-toggle` owns the rail's expanded/compact width with no
Elm-side counterpart either.

-- SEARCH


{-| The search overlay. Unlike `settingsBottomSheet` (always mounted, toggled
via its own `open` attribute), this is only mounted in the DOM at all while
`model.searchOpen`: `m3e-search-view` renders a persistent, full-width pill
bar whenever it's present and NOT open (verified against a live build --
neither `contained` nor any other attribute suppresses it), and nothing in
this layout wants that pill sitting anywhere -- the FAB is the only visible
trigger. Conditional rendering sidesteps needing to suppress it via CSS.

The mode is derived from `model.viewportWidth` rather than delegated to the
element's own `mode="auto"` — see `searchModeFor` for why `auto` is a race
this overlay always loses below 600px. `open True` is set unconditionally
here since the element is never mounted in any other state.

**The classes are load-bearing, not decoration.** `m3e-bottom-sheet` is
`position: fixed` on its host and positions itself; `m3e-search-view` is
`:host { display: block }` — plain static flow. Mounted here, as the last
child of `m3e-theme` next to the shell's own `h-dvh` div, it lands directly
BELOW a box that already fills the viewport: measured at 1400x900, the host
sat at `y = 900`, entirely under the fold, so clicking the FAB looked like
it did nothing. (Playwright hid this: `.click()` auto-scrolls and
`toBeVisible()` never asserts in-viewport — hence the bounding-box
assertion in `search.spec.ts`.)

Only DOCKED mode depends on this: `#openDocked` positions its popover from
the shadow `.anchor` inside the host, so the host's own box is what it
follows. Fullscreen mode sets `position: fixed` + `100dvw/100dvh` on the
popover and ignores the host entirely — the classes are harmless there.
`max-w-2xl mx-auto` keeps the docked bar from stretching to a 1400px-wide
pill (the docked popover's width is copied from the anchor's `clientWidth`);
padding is avoided on the host for the same reason, since `clientWidth`
would include it.

the query actually matched. The page title renders as a secondary line
ONLY for a heading entry (context: "this heading lives on that page"); a
page-level entry has nothing to add below its own title.

This distinction also keeps results from colliding in the accessible tree:
a heading entry named e.g. "Button" (the h1 text) and the page-level entry
named "Button < Components < elm-m3e" (the real `<title>`, a reverse
breadcrumb -- see `Shared.breadcrumbTitle` -- which is never bare "Button")
are two different accessible names, not the same string rendered twice.

Clicking navigates (real `a[href]`, an anchor when the heading has a real
id) and fires `CloseSearch` -- the same "navigate closes the panel"
convention `tocPanel`'s jump-links already follow for `CloseToc`.

{-| The whole below-app-bar shell: an `m3e-drawer-container` whose `start` panel
is the current section's hierarchical nav-menu, whose `end` panel is the page's
opt-in TOC, and whose default content is the page body. The nav is `NavItem`
links inside `NavMenuItem` groups inside a `NavMenu`.

Both panels' `start`/`end` attributes render `model.treeOpen`/`model.tocOpen`
DIRECTLY. That directness is the fix for the dead-hamburger bug — see
`drawerSideBreakpointPx`. The only qualifier left on `end` is "does this page
have a TOC at all", which cannot collapse into a stuck constant because the TOC
toggle that drives `tocOpen` isn't rendered on a page with no entries either.

`--m3e-drawer-container-width` is narrowed from the library default (22.5rem =
360px) to 14rem = 224px, which is what keeps the content column readable once
the rail's fixed 220px `expanded` width (`docsNavRail`) is also on screen:
224px panels leave ~516px of content at 960px with one panel open (the
`shell-breakpoints.spec.ts` floor is 500px — narrowed from 17.5rem/280px
specifically to restore that margin once the rail went from a 96px compact
width to 220px expanded), and ~836px at 1280px. See `tocPinBreakpointPx` for
the rest of that budget.

The content pane, `tocPanel`, and `navMenu` each carry `pb-20` below the
Tailwind `md` breakpoint because `docsNavBar` is `fixed ... bottom-0` there
and would otherwise hide the last ~68px of every scrollable panel behind
itself -- `navMenu`'s own `pb-20` went unverified for a while: the one test
asserting this (`shell-breakpoints.spec.ts`, "does not occlude") drove a
route whose tree was, until a routing fix elsewhere gave it real content,
empty and therefore never actually scrollable.

{-| The TOC drawer panel: one `m3e-toc`, pointed at `#main-content` (this
`drawerShell`'s own `<main>`). Unlike the hand-built jump-link list this
replaced, `m3e-toc` discovers its entries itself -- scanning the real
rendered DOM for headings (native `h1`-`h6` and this app's own
`m3e-heading[level]`) rather than needing a page-specific list Elm has to
keep in sync. `end`'s own gate (`drawerShell`) no longer checks emptiness
for the same reason: Elm doesn't know in advance whether a page has any
headings, only `m3e-toc`'s own runtime scan does.

`for="main-content"` also picks up the page's own `Doc.pageHeading`/H1 as a
level-1 entry above its sections -- a minor, known redundancy with the
visible page title, not a bug; excluding it would need `m3e-toc-ignore` on
every page's own H1 (17 routes via `Doc.pageHeading`, ~23 more with their
own local `pageHeading` never routed through it), which is out of scope
here.

`M3e.Events.delegate` is required because `m3e-toc` itself doesn't declare
an `onClick` capability -- only `m3e-toc-item` fires `click`, per its own
`@fires` -- so this relies on that click bubbling up to the element the
listener actually sits on. Closing on ANY click inside the panel (not just
on an item) is an intentional, low-risk approximation of the old
per-link `CloseToc`: below `drawerSideBreakpointPx` the `end` drawer is an
`over`/`push` overlay with the page content `inert` while open, so without
this the user would land on the right heading but be stuck behind the
still-open panel. `update`'s `CloseToc` case is a no-op above that width,
where the panel is `side` and dismissing it would just be taking the TOC
away from someone reading it.

{-| Decode the `<m3e-drawer-container>` `change` event: `event.target.start`/
`.end` are the reflected boolean properties for the two drawers' open state.
Both are decoded together (not just `start`) because a single scrim click can
close BOTH sides in one `change` event (`_handleScrimClick` sets `this.start`
AND `this.end`, per `@m3e/web/dist/drawer-container.js`) — decoding only
`start` would leave `model.endOpen` desynced from the element after a scrim
dismiss. Change events bubbling up from inner components have a target
without these properties, so the decoder fails and Elm ignores them — exactly
what we want.

first place), so decoding that case too would just be an echo. Failing the
decoder for "open" makes Elm ignore that event entirely, the same way
`drawerChangeDecoder` ignores events from a mismatched target.

{-| The docs sidebar nav, an `M3e.NavMenu` of nested `NavMenuItem` groups. Each
leaf's **label** is a real `a[href]` supplied through the `link` seam (see
`navLeaf`): `config/slots.json` declares `NavMenuItem.label`'s `link` kind, so a
link-kind label slots in cleanly and the item navigates like any anchor — no
`onClick` intercept.

The tree is per-route: it renders ONLY the current top-level section's items
(`currentSectionItems`), not every section stacked together. The rail already
identifies which section is current, so a second, redundant "which section am
I in" affordance inside the tree would just be clutter — and it made the
Components branch, with its 7 category sub-groups sitting alongside 4 other
whole sections, the reason the drawer felt overwhelming rather than a page
tree.

{-| The current top-level section's flat page list, looked up by the route's
first path segment (matching `Section.prefix`). Components' list is derived
from the shared component data — sorted alphabetically by label, with "All
components" pinned first (matching `/components/all`'s kitchen-sink page) —
rather than the static lookup every other section uses, since it isn't known
until `Shared.data` loads it. No section sub-groups: `componentCategories`
still exists for `/components/all`'s own grouping, but the tree itself no
longer nests by category (see `navMenu`).

A path with no matching section falls through to `[]` — there is no section
for the tree to show, so the drawer is legitimately empty (the `start`
attribute above gates on `model.treeOpen`, but an empty list here would just
be a panel with nothing in it). Every route in the app currently belongs to
a section, so this is a defensive fallback rather than a live case today.

-- TOP-LEVEL NAV RAIL / NAV BAR


{-| One of the 5 top-level sections the rail/bar switch between. `href` is
where clicking the section navigates to — the section's real landing page
(Guide, Examples) or, for the 3 sections with no landing page yet, its first
real child (see `specs/2026-08-06-nav-rail-migration-design.md`, "Decided
information architecture"). `prefix` is the first URL path segment that
belongs to this section, used only for highlighting which rail/bar item is
current — it is independent of `href` (e.g. Components' `href` is
`/components/button`, but ANY `/components/*` path is "current").

path segment only, so every `/components/*` route (not just `/components/button`
itself) highlights "Components". `UrlPath` is `List String` (`dillonkearns/elm-pages`),
so this is a plain `List.head` check — no string-prefix parsing.

BOTH the app bar's title (`appShellBar`) and the document-title breadcrumb
(`breadcrumbTitle`) -- one lookup, so the two can't drift apart.

`Nothing` means the route belongs to no top-level section -- every route this
docs site links to or navigates between belongs to one, so this is a
defensive fallback rather than a live case in normal navigation. (It is a
live case for `/roundtrip-harness`, the transient route
`scripts/roundtrip/gen-harness-route.mjs` generates during `check:roundtrip`
-- that route has no section prefix and is never linked from the site.)

{-| The document `<title>`: a reverse breadcrumb, most specific first --
e.g. `"Button < Components < elm-m3e"`. `pageTitle` is each route's own bare
name (`View.fromElement`'s argument -- the old hand-typed "· elm-m3e" suffix
was stripped from every route when this was added). The `Head.Seo` title
each route ALSO sets is a separate, deliberately untouched concern
(search-result/social-preview copy, not what shows in the tab).

Every route belongs to one of the 5 top-level sections now (`Route/`'s only
directories are Components, Examples, GettingStarted, Guide, Styles), so
`currentSectionLabel` always resolves to `Just` in practice; the `Nothing`
arm is kept for the same reason `currentSectionLabel` keeps its own -- a
plain exhaustive `case`, not a live special case. (The homepage used to be
the one route with no section, forcing an early return of `pageTitle`
unchanged here; that branch is gone along with `/` itself -- see
`Route.GettingStarted.Welcome`.)

`href` attribute (`config/slots.json`'s `NavItem.actionMap` maps it to elm-pages'
own link handling), not an `onClick`-driven `Msg`. Shared between `docsNavRail`

{-| The search trigger, shared by the rail and the bottom bar -- `size small`,
`extended` with a visible "Search" label, opening the search overlay
(`searchOverlay`). Matches @m3e/web's own nav-rail usage example
(`NavRailElement.d.ts`) composition-for-composition: an icon in the default
slot plus label text in the `label` slot, the same pair of children that
example's own FAB carries (`<m3e-icon>` + `<span slot="label">`) -- an
icon-only FAB was a departure from that reference, not a deliberate choice.

`NavRail` admits `fab` directly in its unnamed slot alongside `navItem`
(`config/slots.json`), so on the rail this is a normal child, not a new slot
to wire. `NavBar`'s `config/slots.json` entry admits ONLY `navItem`, though —
it does not admit `fab` -- so `docsNavBar` below cannot place this inside the
`M3e.navBar` itself; `extraClasses` is how it gets positioned as a floating
sibling instead.
