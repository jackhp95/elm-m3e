module Route.Guide.ToolingRefactors exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/tooling-refactors`): the wow chapter. The linter
isn't only a catch-net — it _refactors for you_. Two moves: it extracts an
inline raw escape into a named seam and rewrites your call site; and it converts
your whole codebase to one approved form, routing anything the target can't
express through seams (which the boundary check then flags). Shown as real
before/after code, not invented.

Run the autofix and the call site is rewritten to that setter. The escape doesn't move somewhere tidier — it stops existing. Before:"""
