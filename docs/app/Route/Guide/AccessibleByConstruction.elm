module Route.Guide.AccessibleByConstruction exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/accessible-by-construction`): accessibility as
structure, not a checklist. An icon-only control has no visible text, so its
accessible name is required. The Aria setters are first-class on every
component, and the codegen-aware `missingRequiredAttribute` rule reads the
per-component facts and refuses a nameless control when elm-review runs in CI.
The running example gains an icon-only help button (labeled, live); the nameless
version is shown as code beside the rule's real output.

{-| An icon-only help button — WITH its accessible name. This is the version
you should ship and it renders. The nameless version is shown only as code,

intro : String

    """Accessibility here is built into the shape of the components, not bolted on as a checklist at the end. The clearest case: a control with no visible text. Our settings panel needs a small **help** button that's just an icon. A sighted user sees a "?"; a screen-reader user needs a name to read. So that name is **required** — and the accessible-name attributes (`Aria.label`, `labelledby`, `describedby`) are first-class setters on every component, right where you'd reach for them."""


labeled : String
labeled =
    """Add the help button *with* its accessible name and it's fine — this renders, and it announces itself as "Help":"""


nameless : String
nameless =
    """Now drop the name. Since the `el`-unification, an icon button's accessible name isn't a linter-checked attribute anymore — `ariaLabel` is a **required record field** on `IconButton.el` itself, the same required-record mechanism that makes forgetting a Button's `action` impossible (see [the strictness dial](/guide/strictness)). Try to omit it and the build stops — the message below is the compiler's real output:"""



-- @sample expect-compile-error: the page's claim, in one line. It does NOT
-- compile — that is the point — the required-record `el` shape is what
-- refuses it, so this is checked against a real `elm make` run, not a lint
-- pass. (Pre `el`-unification this was `expect-review MissingRequiredAttribute`
-- — a linter guarantee; the required-record collapse promoted the SAME check
-- to a compiler guarantee.)

wiring : String

    """This is "accessible by construction" in practice: the requirement lives in the component's own required-record shape, so `elm make` refuses the unlabeled control instead of a human having to remember. It is a **compiler** guarantee now — no elm-review run required, no CI step to forget to wire up. And when a control has a visible label — like the text fields we build next — the label and input are wired from one shared id, so you never hand-type a matching `for`/`id` pair."""

- `ariaLabel` is a **required record field** on `IconButton.el` — omitting it is a **compile error**, not a lint finding, so there's no CI step to forget.
- Visible labels are **wired to their input for you** from one shared id — no hand-typed `for`/`id`.
- **Next: [Composition, not injection](/guide/composition-text-field) →** build a text field that doesn't exist as a component — by composition."""
