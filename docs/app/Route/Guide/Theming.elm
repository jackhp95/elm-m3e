module Route.Guide.Theming exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/theming`): theming an elm-m3e app the Material way —
one root `M3e.Theme` fed a seed color plus scheme / contrast / density, the
derived `--md-sys-*` token roles, dark and dynamic color as swaps not stylesheets,
a worked brand re-skin, and the layout-only Tailwind boundary. The governing
principle is "re-skin with tokens, don't restyle with class overrides", which the
`NoProprietaryDsClasses` rule enforces mechanically. Deep color-system theory
(tonal palettes, dynamic-color derivation) lives in the m3e-okf knowledge base;
this page is the Elm/`M3e.Theme` practice.

    """Material 3 theming is *token-driven*. You do not hand-author a palette: you give the system a small number of inputs — one seed color, a scheme, a contrast, a density — and it derives the full set of color roles (primary, secondary, tertiary, their containers, the surface ramp, outline, error…) as `--md-sys-*` CSS custom properties. Every `@m3e/web` component reads those tokens, so styling the whole app is a matter of setting the inputs once and reaching for roles, never raw colors.

For the neutral *theory* — how dynamic color derives a tonal palette from a single seed, what the tonal system and the type scale are, why design tokens decouple intent from value — read the **m3e-okf knowledge base** (`github.com/jackhp95/m3e-okf`), pages `styles/color`, `styles/typography`, and `foundations/design-tokens`. This guide is the Elm-specific how-to: the `M3e.Theme` component and the practice that keeps a theme a theme."""
