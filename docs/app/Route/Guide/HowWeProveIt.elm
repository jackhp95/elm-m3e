module Route.Guide.HowWeProveIt exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/how-we-prove-it`): earned trust. Every example in
these docs starts as real component markup, is converted across forms,
compiled, rendered back to HTML, and diffed against the original. Where it drifts
or leans on an escape, that's a measured signal we track, not something hidden.
That's why you can copy any example here and trust it. The meta-chapter — no new
running-example beat.

Every figure on this page is derived at build time from the SAME source the
[`/roundtrip`](/roundtrip) report renders: `data/roundtrip-report.json`. Nothing
here is hand-typed, so the guide and the report can never drift apart. We headline
the **top** form (`M3e.Button.view` — the typed, slot-safe layer the guide
teaches first); the full per-form table lives on `/roundtrip`.

{-| The headline form's round-trip breakdown, computed at build time from
`data/roundtrip-report.json` so this chapter and `/roundtrip` share one source.

  - `total` — examples in the corpus (matches `/roundtrip`'s denominator).
  - `converted` — of those, how many this API could express at all.
  - `cleanIdentity` — converted and round-tripped byte-for-byte.
  - `allowedAlias` — round-tripped with cosmetic-only deviations (functionally
    identical output; e.g. an added `role="group"`). Counted, not hidden.
  - `functionalDrift` — a real, functional mismatch. This is the number that
    must stay honest.

When we render an example back to HTML, some differences are *cosmetic*: the browser or the component's own template adds an attribute that doesn't change what the component *does* or *shows*. We record those, mark them cosmetic, and set them aside from the honest-drift count.

Here's a real one from the run. The **Autocomplete** example (`Autocomplete/8`) is authored without an ARIA role on its option list. When m3e renders it back, the component adds `role="group"` itself:

```
- <div class="options">…</div>          (authored)
+ <div class="options" role="group">…</div>   (round-tripped)
```

The output is functionally identical — same element, same children, same behavior; the platform just annotated it. That's an **allowed alias**: counted in the `allowed alias` line, never in `unexpected drift`. Contrast it with a *functional* deviation — a dropped `filter="starts-with"` attribute that actually changes matching behavior. That one lands in `unexpected drift`, in red, at the top of the [round-trip report](/roundtrip)."""
