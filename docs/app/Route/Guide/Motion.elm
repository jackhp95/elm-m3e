module Route.Guide.Motion exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/motion`): the motion division of responsibility. Material 3
Expressive motion (spring physics, shape morphing, state-layer ripples, enter/exit
choreography) ships *inside* the `@m3e/web` custom elements and is driven by the
`M3e.Theme` motion scheme — you do not hand-animate it. What the Elm author controls
is the motion *between* those components: the AVT snackbar in `js/avt-snackbar.js`,
cross-route view transitions, and honoring reduced-motion. Deep motion physics
(spring constants, duration/easing tokens) lives in the m3e-okf knowledge base and the
`/styles/motion` token page; this page draws the boundary.

intro =
    """Material 3 Expressive is, in large part, a *motion* system: springy emphasis, shape that morphs under pressure, state layers that ripple, containers that expand and collapse with choreographed enter/exit. The good news for an Elm author is that almost none of this is yours to implement. It ships **inside** the `@m3e/web` custom elements, and you turn its character up or down with a single `M3e.Theme` input. What you *do* own is the motion *between* components — the transitions your app state drives.

For the neutral motion *theory* — the spring model, the duration and easing token scale, why expressive emphasis reads as more alive — see the **m3e-okf knowledge base** (`github.com/jackhp95/m3e-okf`, `styles/motion`) and the token catalog on the [Styles → Motion](/styles/motion) page. This guide draws the boundary between the two."""


shippedBody : String
shippedBody =
    """The custom elements animate themselves. A `Button` ripples its state layer on press; a `Fab` and the shape components morph corner geometry; a `Dialog`, `BottomSheet`, `Menu`, and `Accordion` run their own choreographed enter/exit; a `Switch`/`Slider` thumb springs to its new position; `NavItem` indicators slide. You never write a keyframe or a transition for any of it. You choose its *character* once, at the root, with the `M3e.Theme` motion scheme:"""

shippedNote : String

It is one input, published to every nested component through the `--md-sys-motion-*` tokens — the same theme-at-the-root pattern as color (see [Theming](/guide/theming)). Do not try to reproduce a spring by hand in Elm; you would fight the element's own animation and lose the token-scheme coupling."""


authorBody : String

    """Elm owns the transitions your *application* drives — the ones no single component can see, because they cross component or route boundaries:

| Motion | Owner | How |

| Ripple / press feedback, shape morph, thumb spring | `@m3e/web` | Ships in the element; tune via `Theme.motion` |
| Dialog / sheet / menu enter + exit | `@m3e/web` | The element choreographs its own open/close |
| A **snackbar** sliding in on app state | **You** | Render the AVT snackbar element (below) |
| **Cross-route** page transition | **You** | The browser View Transitions API, opt-in |
| A list reordering, a filtered set reflowing | **You** | Your own state + a transition you author |
| Respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` | **Shared** | The elements honor it; your own transitions must too |

Rule of thumb: if the motion belongs to *one component's own lifecycle*, it is already handled. If the motion expresses *your app changing state*, it is yours to wire."""


snackbarBody : String

The repo bridges that gap with a tiny declarative custom element, [`js/avt-snackbar.js`](https://github.com/jackhp95/elm-m3e/blob/main/js/avt-snackbar.js): Elm owns visibility (render the element when you want a toast shown), and the element drives the imperative singleton on connect. It reads `message` / `action` / `dismissible` / `duration` attributes and dispatches a bubbling `avt-snackbar-action` event you round-trip back to a `Msg`:"""

It is opt-in and progressive: where it is unsupported the navigation simply happens instantly, with no broken state. Because elm-pages owns navigation, wiring it is an app-shell concern (a `view-transition-name` on the shared elements and a `startViewTransition` on route change), not something any `M3e.*` component provides. Keep these transitions *functional* — they orient the user across a route change; they are not decoration — and always let them degrade to an instant cut."""


reducedBody : String
reducedBody =
    """Some users set `prefers-reduced-motion` because motion makes them ill. This is an accessibility requirement, not a preference to ignore. The `@m3e/web` elements already honor it, and the docs' own JS does too — [`js/slide-panels.js`](https://github.com/jackhp95/elm-m3e/blob/main/js/slide-panels.js) notes that its height/transform transitions are zeroed by a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query in CSS, so no JS branch is needed. **Any motion you author yourself must do the same**: gate your CSS transitions behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`, and never make a state change *depend* on an animation completing.

- **You wire the motion *between* components**: the [`avt-snackbar`](https://github.com/jackhp95/elm-m3e/blob/main/js/avt-snackbar.js) (Elm owns visibility, the element owns the slide), cross-route **view transitions**, and your own reflow transitions.
- **Reduced motion is required**: the elements honor it, and so must anything you author — gate transitions behind `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.
- Deep motion physics and the token scale live in **m3e-okf** and the [Styles → Motion](/styles/motion) page; this page is just the boundary."""
