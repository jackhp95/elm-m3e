module Route.Guide.Accessibility exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/accessibility`): the accessibility reference for elm-m3e —
the named-slot vs `M3e.Aria.label` / `Aria.label` decision, focus behavior in
Dialog / Menu / BottomSheet (what `@m3e/web` handles vs what the Elm author wires),
keyboard interaction per component family, and testing with the Playwright a11y-tree
harness in `docs/tests-browser/`. The narrow "accessible name is required" teaching
moment lives at `/guide/accessible-by-construction`; this is the fuller how-to and
mirrors the `making-m3e-accessible` skill. WCAG theory (contrast ratios,
name/role/value, focus-visible) lives in the m3e-okf knowledge base.

    """Accessibility in elm-m3e is largely *structural*, not a checklist you run at the end — an icon-only control has no visible text, so its accessible name is *required* by the component's own facts (the [Accessibility you can't forget](/guide/accessible-by-construction) chapter shows that one idea live). This page is the fuller reference: how to name every control, who owns focus in dialogs and menus, what keyboard behavior each family gives you for free, and how to spot-check the result.

For WCAG *rationale* — the contrast ratios, the name/role/value model, why focus-visible matters — read the **m3e-okf knowledge base** (`github.com/jackhp95/m3e-okf`, `foundations/accessibility`). This page is the Elm practice that applies it, and it is kept in lockstep with the `making-m3e-accessible` skill."""

nameBody =
    """Every interactive control needs an accessible name. Decide by whether the control already has visible text:

- **Has visible text** (a labelled button, a nav item with a label) — the text *is* the name. The named/text slot supplies it; add nothing.
- **Icon-only** (icon button, icon-only FAB, a `Switch`/`Radio` whose label sits in a sibling) — there is no text, so an explicit ARIA name is **required**.
- **Name lives in another visible element** — reference it with `M3e.ariaLabelledby "that-id"` instead of duplicating the string.

The shipped, correct icon-only control (this one renders and announces as "Back"):"""

They are first-class on *every* component, right where you reach for the other attributes — accessibility is not a separate module you have to remember to import.

| **Menu / Select** | `↑` `↓` move the active item (roving focus), `Enter` selects, `Esc` closes, typeahead jumps |
| **List / NavRail / NavBar** | Arrow keys move within the group; `Tab` enters/leaves the group once |
| **Tabs** | `←` `→` move the active tab, `Home`/`End` jump to ends, the panel follows |
| **Radio group** | Arrow keys move selection *within* the group; the group is one `Tab` stop |
| **Slider** | Arrow keys step the value; `Home`/`End` go to min/max |
| **Dialog / BottomSheet** | `Esc` closes; `Tab` is trapped within |

Two things this table implies you own: give a `Radio` group **one shared `name`** so it reads and arrows as a single control (the Settings `themeRow` uses `TA.name "theme"`), and keep **DOM/slot children in meaningful order**, because screen readers and Tab both follow source order."""

| Focus trap, `Escape`, return-focus on its own overlays | **Focus across route/state changes** (into a new page's heading) |
| Focus ring / focus-visible (strengthen with `Theme.strongFocus`) | **Grouping semantics** you own (shared `name` on a radio group) |

These are **advisory / report-only** for content the analyzer can't resolve statically (dynamic, `List.map`-built rows): a static-analysis limit, not a bug.

1. Serve the app and **wait until the custom elements upgrade** — poll for a component's `shadowRoot` rather than `networkidle`, which never fires under the dev SSE stream.
2. Snapshot the accessibility tree and assert every interactive node has a non-empty accessible name.
3. `Tab` through and assert the focus order is sensible and a visible focus ring appears.
4. For dialogs/menus, assert `Escape` closes and focus returns to the trigger."""
