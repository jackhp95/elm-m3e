module Route.Guide.GeneratedAndInspectable exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/generated-and-inspectable`): why the API is
trustworthy. The typed Elm modules are generated — from the component library's
published manifest plus a hand-authored `config/slots.json` — so no one types
the API by hand, and a component is not opaque HTML but inspectable data the
library turns into HTML exactly once, at the app root. That single fact is what
makes the later chapters (the linter, the seams) possible. No visual change to
the running example; the same Save button, seen for what it really is.

generated : String
generated =
    """**You don't type the API by hand — a generator writes it.** The component library ships a *manifest* — a machine-readable list of every component, its attributes, and its slots. A generator turns that manifest, together with one hand-authored file (`config/slots.json`, which records slot kinds and required attributes the manifest doesn't carry), into the typed Elm you import. The names, the attributes, the slots you'll learn are the components' own — not a per-component wrapper someone hand-maintains and forgets to update.

That does mean the API isn't *fully* automatic: when a new version of the components ships, you regenerate, and any component the manifest adds that `config/slots.json` doesn't yet cover falls back to loose `any` slots until the config is updated. So the API stays in step by a regen you run — not on its own — and because an uncovered component surfaces as loose `any` slots, that gap is visible in the generated output rather than silent."""


inspectable : String
inspectable =
    """**A component isn't opaque HTML — it's inspectable data.** `M3e.button [ M3e.Attributes.variant Value.filled ] [ Kit.text "Save" ]` doesn't produce HTML on the spot. It builds a small value the library can *read*: it knows this is a button, that it's filled, that its content is the text "Save". Your whole page stays as this readable data right up until one conversion — `HtmlIr.Element.toNode` — at your app's root, which turns the entire tree into HTML exactly once.

Because the library can inspect what you built *before* it becomes HTML, it can enforce rules a plain HTML wrapper never could — the next chapters are all cashing in on this one fact."""

- A component is **inspectable data** the library reads, then turns into HTML **once, at the root** (`HtmlIr.Element.toNode`).
- That's why the library can catch mistakes the browser never sees.
- **Next: [The layer map](/guide/the-layers) →** the same button, shown as a the layers — safe at the top, raw at the bottom."""
