module Route.Guide.InvalidStates exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/invalid-states`): the headline promise, felt.
Every piece carries an invisible tag for the KIND of content it is; every slot
says which kinds it accepts; a mismatch is a compile error. The running Save
button gains an icon (valid), and putting the wrong kind of thing in the icon
slot stops the build — shown as the real compiler output, not an assertion.

Every piece of content carries an invisible tag for its **kind** — the category it is: an icon, some text, a button. And every **slot** — a labeled place a component puts content — declares which kinds it will accept. Line those up and it compiles. Mismatch them and it doesn't."""

readError =
    """Read it the plain way: *"this is a chip; the icon slot only takes icons."* The compiler even guesses your intent — *maybe chip should be icon?* You never shipped a broken button, because it was never a value you could build. The same guard covers variants: a variant that doesn't exist isn't a name you can type — only the real tokens (`M3e.variantFilled`, `M3e.variantOutlined`, …) exist at all.

**The browser never sees the mistake — the compiler does.**

One boundary to be precise about: this hard, compile-time guard is what the *type system* gives you — a wrong-kind child in a named slot, or a token that doesn't exist. The component-agnostic slot setters (`M3e.slotLeading`, …) accept the *union* of every component's kinds, so placing a child in a slot the container doesn't declare is caught not by the compiler but by an elm-review rule (`Cem.ValidSlotKind`) — which you run in CI. The next chapter is the dial for exactly this: what the compiler holds versus what the linter holds."""

- A mismatch is a **compile error** — the wrong UI is never a value you can build.

- **Next: [The strictness dial](/guide/strictness) →** the compiler leaves some checks loose on purpose — here's the dial that turns them back up."""
