module Route.Guide.CheatSheet exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide · Cheat sheet (`/guide/cheat-sheet`): the return-worthy tables in one
place — the surfaces, the strictness dial, loose vs. tight vocabulary, and where
a seam is allowed to live. Scannable reference, not narrative; the chapters teach
these, this is where you come back to look them up.

| Surface | What it is | You reach for it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **barrel / standard constructor** | The standard form — typed, slot-safe, composes into other components. | Almost always — the default. |
| **component module `el`** | Same value; bare (`attrs -> children -> Element`) when the component has no required parts, or required-record (`{ … } -> attrs -> children -> Element`) when it does. Each component has exactly one shape. | Component-scoped tighter types, or when the compiler must not let you forget a required part. |
| **`M3e.Html.*` (loose)** | The open-rowed producer — no slot/attr checking, still in the IR. Not plain HTML. | Opting out of the strict rows on purpose. |
| **`M3e.Coerce` / `M3e.Unsafe`** | Escapes: kind crossing / raw `Html`. Loud, greppable, lint-flagged. | Leaving the typed tree when nothing else fits. |"""

seams : String

Everything is a typed `Element` from `M3e.*` / `TypedHtml.*`, composed directly — you never import `HtmlIr` (the barrel re-exports `M3e.Element` / `M3e.Attr` and `M3e.mapMsg`). To bring in something *foreign*, there is exactly one loud, greppable, lint-fenced escape surface, shipped with the library itself:

| Escape | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| **`<Brand>.Unsafe`** / **`.Unsafe.Attributes`** | `fromHtml` / `fromHtmlAttribute` lift raw `Html`; `recast` / `recastAttr` re-kind to free rows so anything drops into any slot; `customElement` / `customAttribute` forge a tag or attribute the library has no producer for. Fenced by `NoUnsafeImportOutsideAllowed`. |

Underneath, `Unsafe` is built on the raw forge `HtmlIr.Internal` (`fromNode`, `node` / `attribute` / `property` / `on`, `lazy`..`lazy8`) — but that forge is fenced to the library's own generated code by `NoInternalImportOutsideAllowed`; application code has no reason to import it.

A "seam" isn't a library feature — it's the *practice* of corralling those escapes into one greppable place, a small named producer next to the code that needs it. Anywhere else a raw escape is flagged, and the linter offers to lift it into an escape for you."""
