module Route.Guide.Seams exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/seams`): the real escapes — a third-party custom element,
raw `Html`, a break-glass `recast` — ship _with the library_, fenced into one
lint-guarded place: `M3e.Unsafe` and `M3e.Unsafe.Attributes`. There is no
userland adapter module to hand-write anymore. Most code needs none of it:
standard HTML stays typed (`TypedHtml`), and most "custom" content just fills
a typed slot. This page shows the real reach (`M3e.Unsafe.customElement` for
`<model-viewer>`) next to the close calls that only look like one. The
two-column layout is live; the producers are shown as code.

The important half is what *stays* checked. `M3e.Unsafe.recast` would also have got the div in, by throwing away every row on the way; this keeps them. The div still has to be legal where it sits, and its children still have to be legal inside a div. You didn't buy admission by going blind."""


oneWay : String
oneWay =
    """**The other direction is a designed limit, not a gap to route around.** An M3e component will not go inside a native container whose content model is enumerated — `<span>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<li>`, `<td>`:

The reason is the same rule that makes slots work at all: a producer's named kinds must be a **subset** of the slot's. `M3e.heading` names `heading` so that `AppBar.title` can tell a heading from a card — and that same field is what `SpanContent` has no name for. Erasing it would let M3e components into native containers *and* let a Card into a Menu. You can have a component discriminated by its own design system, or admitted by a foreign library's enumerated slots. Not both.

In practice it rarely bites, and there are three honest answers before you reach for an escape:

1. **Use a flow container.** `TypedHtml.div`, `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, `main_`, `nav`, `form`, `figure`, `aside`, `details`, `dialog` and 20-odd others take any children at all. Wrapping a component in a `<div>` is not a workaround — it is what the content model already says.
2. **Check the slot first.** Text and icons cross both ways as shared atoms, so `M3e.text` and `M3e.icon` sit inside native phrasing content directly.
3. **`M3e.Coerce`** for a crossing the design system has blessed in config, and **`M3e.Unsafe.recast`** for the one-off where the design system is genuinely wrong. Both are loud, named and lint-fenced — which is the point of this page.

Two smaller residues, for completeness: a bare `<img>` or `<area>` keeps a per-tag kind (so `<picture>` and `<map>` stay exact) and needs a wrapper to enter an M3e slot; and `<dl>`/`<option>` accept any flow content rather than the narrower set the spec names."""


payoff : String
payoff =
    """That is the whole discipline: **type everything you can, seam only what you must, and keep the seams in one place.** Layout and text are typed producers. Slots take typed kinds. The genuine escapes — a custom element, raw `Html` via `fromHtml`, or the break-glass `recast` when the design system is truly wrong for a case — are named, lint-fenced, and already live in one place: `M3e.Unsafe` and `M3e.Unsafe.Attributes`. Your job is narrower than it used to be — call them from a small, named producer (like `modelViewer` above) instead of inline at every call site. You escaped the types where you had to and **kept** the guarantees everywhere else, because every real escape is loud, contained, and greppable."""
