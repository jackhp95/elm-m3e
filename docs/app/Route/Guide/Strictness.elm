module Route.Guide.Strictness exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/strictness`): choose how strict your project is.
The compiler enforces kinds and valid tokens but deliberately leaves the softer
"did you fill the required slot?" loose on the standard surface, so that tax
doesn't land on every call site. You dial those back up two ways: a linter that knows
your components, and stricter call-shapes you opt into per component (options
list, required record, pipeline) — peers, each promoting one advisory check to a
compile guarantee. The live demo stays the barrel Save button; the alternative
shapes are shown as code with their real compiler output.

intro : String
intro =
    """The compiler holds a lot for you — kinds line up, and only real tokens exist. But it *deliberately* stays quiet about softer questions like "did you fill the slot this component needs?" on the standard surface, because forcing that on every call site would tax the easy path. Strictness here isn't all-or-nothing: **you start easy and turn it up where it's worth it** — project-wide with the linter, or per call site with a stricter surface.

A quick word on vocabulary, since it shows up below: a **surface** is one of a component's interchangeable call-shapes you'll map in full at [the surface map](/guide/the-layers), the **barrel** is the one-import `M3e` API, and a **component module** is a per-component import (`import M3e.Button`) with tighter, component-scoped types."""


linter : String
linter =
    """A linter that knows your components reads the same component list the API was generated from, so it can flag things the types leave loose: an enum token that type-checked through the shared `M3e.Attributes.*` vocabulary but isn't valid for *this* component, a required content slot you left empty, or a child placed in a slot the container doesn't declare (`Cem.ValidSlotKind`). These are **linter-guaranteed, not compiler-guaranteed** — the linter is a separate pass, so it only protects you if you **run elm-review in CI**. Run there, it catches the soft misses the compiler waves through on purpose. (One caveat worth naming: `Cem.ValidSlotKind` is `Lenient` by default and can't resolve a child's kind through a `List.map` or a let-binding, so it's a strong net, not an absolute one.)"""


shapes : String
shapes =
    """Stricter call-shapes, chosen per component. A component isn't one function shape; each ships several **surfaces**, and they all render the *same* button. They differ only in what you're allowed to leave out — they are **peers, not a ranking**, and you pick per call site:"""
