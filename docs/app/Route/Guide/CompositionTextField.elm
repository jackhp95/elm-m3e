module Route.Guide.CompositionTextField exposing (ActionData, Data, Model, Msg, route)

{-| Guide (`/guide/composition-text-field`): build things that
aren't single components. There is no `M3e.TextField`; a text field is composed
from a form field, a typed native `<input>`, and a label wired to that input by
one shared id. Native HTML is first-class and typed; the library assembles what
you wrote and never injects structure around it. The running example gains an
Email field, live, beside its exact source.

You get the exact tag you asked for, with the exact attributes it's allowed.

Second, **the library never injects.** It assembles the pieces you wrote — it doesn't secretly wrap, reorder, or add structure around your content. What you write is what renders. A search field is the same move with a different input `type_`; once you can compose one field, you can compose any of them."""
