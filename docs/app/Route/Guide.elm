The whole thing in one line: **the correct way and the easy way are the same way — the top. You reach lower, loudly and on purpose, only to escape.** A few checks stay loose there by default so the tax doesn't land on every call site; [the strictness dial](/guide/strictness) is how you turn those back up when you want them."""

Work them top to bottom."""
