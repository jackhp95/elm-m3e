/**
 * Mobile bottom-nav contract, shared by every full-viewport example route.
 *
 * These pages each own 100% of their own layout (they deliberately skip the
 * docs shell — see `app-shell.spec.ts`), so nothing else pins this for them.
 * Before this contract existed, each bar was `position: fixed inset-x-0
 * bottom-0`: out of flow, floating over the scroll region beneath it, and
 * therefore requiring a compensating `pb-24` on every scrollable region that
 * might reach the viewport bottom.
 *
 * That compensation is the bug this guards against. It has to be remembered
 * separately for every current AND future scroll region, it is invisible when
 * forgotten (content looks fine until you scroll to the very end), and it was
 * in fact forgotten more than once — `Settings.elm` had it on the content
 * wrapper but not on the sibling `exampleFooter`, and the docs shell shipped a
 * drawer region without it.
 *
 * An in-flow bar cannot occlude anything above it, by construction. These
 * assertions pin that structural property rather than the padding workaround,
 * so a regression to `fixed` fails here instead of silently hiding content.
 *
 * `/examples/dashboard` is deliberately NOT in this list: it uses a `sticky
 * bottom-0` bar over a `min-h-screen` document-scrolling page, which is a
 * different (and intentional) pattern, not the `fixed` one this replaced.
