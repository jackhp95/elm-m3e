{-| The facts both brands contribute, in ladder order.

M3e first is deliberate: when a redundant escape could be replaced by either a
design-system setter or a native one, the M3e suggestion is the one a reader
should see first. That is the same `M3e > TypedHtml > escape` ordering the
`auditing-m3e-escapes` skill enforces by hand.

{-| The M3e-specific project-discipline rules.

**Escape discipline is three layers, not one**, because each catches what the
others structurally cannot:

1.  `NoUnsafeImportOutsideAllowed` — the _import_ fence. One error per module,
    naming no call site. Cheap, and it is the only layer that fires when a module
    has no business holding an escape at all.
2.  `NoRedundantAttributeEscape` / `NoRedundantElementEscape` — the _use_ layer.
    These name the specific call and the typed alternative that already exists,
    which the import fence cannot do, and they stay silent for modules that are
    allow-listed above.
3.  `NoRedundantElementForge` — the _producer_ layer, for a blessed adapter
    re-forging a plain tag `TypedHtml.*` already provides.

This replaces `NoSeamOutsideAllowedModules`'s old job of fencing `*.Unsafe`
directly (repurposed to that after the userland `Seam` module was deleted):
`NoUnsafeImportOutsideAllowed` was built for exactly that job, and running two
rules over one boundary is how they drift apart.

**`NoSeamOutsideAllowedModules` is still in the list below**, but for a
narrower, forward-looking job: containing `Recast`, the reserved destination
module name `ExtractToSeam` (`jackhp95/elm-review-cem`, opt-in `--fix`, kept
OUT of this gate) writes escapes into when a team runs it to hoist scattered
`M3e.Unsafe.recast` / `M3e.Unsafe.Attributes.recastAttr` calls into one place.
Today no `Recast` module exists in this project, so this entry is a no-op
(zero live findings) — but the import fence above only ever gates literal
`import *.Unsafe`, so a _hoisted_ `Recast.recastFoo` call site would import
`Recast`, not `M3e.Unsafe`, and would silently slip past it. Reserving
`"Recast"` here means the day someone runs `ExtractToSeam` with
`recastModule = "Recast"`, containment is already live with no further gate
change. If a team picks a different `recastModule` name, add it to both this
rule's `seamModules` and the import fence's allow-list (`Recast` is
allow-listed there too, since the destination module legitimately imports
`M3e.Unsafe` to wrap it).

    [ -- The import fence. Allowed holders, and why each earns it:
      --   `M3e` / `TypedHtml` — generated brand code imports its own escapes.
      --   `Doc` / `Doc.Slider` — the doc-rendering adapters (Markdown, syntax
      --     highlighting, a `<slide-panels>` custom element).
      --   `Shared` — the app-shell root; raw `Html` chrome and the render exit.
      --   `View` — the page boundary; the app's single re-assertion of phantom
      --     rows onto an erased `Node`.
      --   `Route.Examples.Shop` — one documented `recast`; `AppBar.TrailingSlot`
      --     genuinely does not admit a Badge.

      --     escape surface, shown inline as live examples.
      --   `Recast` — reserved `ExtractToSeam` destination (see docstring); the
      --     hoisted module itself is allowed to hold the `M3e.Unsafe` import
      --     it wraps.

      --     recast raw swatch/panel nodes into typed slots through the same
      --     sanctioned `M3e.Unsafe.recast` escape they document.
