{-| The context a guide sample assumes but does not show.

Guide samples are *fragments*. They read as if they sit inside an application
that already has a `model`, a `Msg` type, and some sibling elements — because
that is how a reader will meet them. This module supplies exactly those names so
each fragment can be compiled verbatim, without editing the sample into something
the guide does not actually display.

**These stubs are deliberately polymorphic** (that is what `M3e.Unsafe.recast`
is doing below — erasing the row so the stub satisfies whatever row a sample's
real call needs). That is a known, bounded weakening: a stub can never *prove* a
kind is admitted, it only declines to disprove it. Everything the sample itself
writes — every module, function, attribute setter, slot and enum token — is
still checked for real. Keep the stub set small and boring; if a sample needs a
*specific* type to be meaningful, write that value in the sample.
