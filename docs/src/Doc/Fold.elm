module Doc.Fold exposing (Node, buildForest, serialize, viewWith)

{-| Auto-derived code folding for the docs' code blocks.

The render seam (`Doc.code_`) can only hand us a **raw code string** — the
`SyntaxHighlight.HCode`/`Line` internals are opaque, so we cannot fold a
pre-highlighted block. Instead we compute a **fold tree from the raw string**
here (pure, unit-tested) and assemble nested native `<details>` ourselves,
highlighting **per line** with a caller-supplied `String -> Html msg`
(`SyntaxHighlight.<lang> line |> toInlineHtml`, keeping the `.elmshN` token
classes; caller falls back to plain `text` on `Err`).

Two derivations, both purely from indentation/text (no generator markers, so the
result is identical across every surface tab):

  - **Indentation chevron folds** (Phase 1): a line whose next non-blank line is
    more deeply indented is a fold _header_; its body spans following lines until
    indentation returns to `<=` the header indent. Regions nest. Every fold now
    renders **open** by default; `defaultCollapseThreshold` is retained only as
    part of the fold-tree data model exercised by `serialize`/`FoldTest.elm` and
    no longer drives the rendered `open` state.

  - **Repeated-sibling `…` folds** (Phase 2): a run of `>= 3` consecutive
    single-line siblings at equal indent whose leading construct is identical
    (e.g. `M3e.Option.view …` or `<m3e-option …`) collapses into one `…`
    affordance. The detector is deliberately conservative — it groups only when
    the leading `M3e.<name>` / `<tag` head matches exactly, so distinct lines
    (differing slot names, args, etc.) are never mis-collapsed. If real examples
    ever show a false positive, drop `coalesceSiblings` from `buildForest` and
    Phase 1 still stands on its own.

`buildForest`/`Node`/`serialize` are exposed for the unit tests (`tests/FoldTest.elm`).

{-| A node in the fold tree.

  - `Leaf` — a plain code line, kept verbatim (with its leading indentation).
  - `Fold` — an indentation region: a header line + a nested body; `collapsed`
    is a data-model flag exercised by `serialize`/`FoldTest.elm`, not the
    rendered `open` state (folds render open by default).
  - `Siblings` — a `>= 3` run of repeated single-line siblings, rendered as `…`.
