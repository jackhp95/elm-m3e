{-| Which API surface a Usage example is shown in:

  - `Top` — the barrel `M3e.*` form (the Standard surface, always present)
  - `Record` — `M3e.<Comp>.el { … }` (the required-record surface; per-example)
  - `Build` — `M3e.<Comp>.build |> … |> toElement` (the builder-pipe surface; per-example)
  - `Raw` — the raw `<m3e-*>` HTML (always present)

`M3e` and `HTML` are verified for every example, so those two tabs are always
offered. The `record` / `build` surfaces are offered whenever `top` is — when
their own field is non-null they show a real translation, and when it's null they
show an _identical-by-design_ rationale (the example's content carried nothing for
that surface to enforce). Only a composite with no single-component `top` form
drops them entirely.

surface compiled to a distinct form for this example (else `Nothing`; the UI hides
the `top` tab, but keeps `record`/`build` as an identical-by-design rationale tab).

heading over its per-section sub-headings and examples. Empty ⇒ nothing (so it
drops cleanly out of the top-level `space-y-10` rhythm).

Both the "Usage" heading and each named sub-heading carry a stable `id`
(`Doc.slugify` of their own text) rather than the random id `m3e-toc`'s own
generator falls back to for an unidentified heading -- a stable id keeps
`#usage`/`#variants`-style URLs bookmarkable across reloads. `Shared.tocPanel`
mounts a single `m3e-toc` that discovers these headings (and everything
else on the page) at runtime; nothing here needs to enumerate them.

trips a spurious vertical scrollbar on the control's state-surface bleed.

`Top` is only offered by `surfacesFor` when its field is present, so its `Nothing`
branch is defensive (falls back to HTML). `Record` and `Build` ARE offered with a
null field — when this example's content had nothing for that surface to lift, the
surface is identical to `M3e` by design, so we show a short rationale instead of a
hollow duplicate.
