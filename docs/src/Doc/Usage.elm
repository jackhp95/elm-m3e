{-| Which API surface a Usage example is shown in:

  - `Top` — the barrel `M3e.*` form (the Standard surface, always present)
  - `Record` — `M3e.<Comp>.el { … }` (the required-record surface; per-example)
  - `Build` — `M3e.<Comp>.build |> … |> toElement` (the builder-pipe surface; per-example)
  - `Raw` — the raw `<m3e-*>` HTML (always present)

`M3e` and `HTML` are verified for every example, so those two tabs are always
offered. The `record` / `build` surfaces are offered whenever `top` is — when
their own field is non-null they show a real translation, and when it's null they
show an _identical-by-design_ rationale (the example's content carried nothing for
that surface to enforce). Only a composite with no single-component `top` form
drops them entirely.

{-| Per-example surface selection, keyed by each example's global index on the page
(assigned before section grouping). A missing key means the example is still on
its default surface — so the model starts empty and only records deviations,
and each example's tabs move independently of every other's.

{-| A verified Usage example: its live-preview HTML and the derived Elm in each
API surface. Every Elm surface is optional — `top` (M3e) and `record`
(`M3e.<Comp>.el`) / `build` (`M3e.<Comp>.build`) are each present only when that
surface compiled to a distinct form for this example (else `Nothing`; the UI hides
the `top` tab, but keeps `record`/`build` as an identical-by-design rationale tab).
`html` is the one guaranteed surface — its live preview always renders. `section`
groups examples under a sub-heading ("" = ungrouped).

{-| Render the Usage section as a single spacing-consistent block: a "Usage"
heading over its per-section sub-headings and examples. Empty ⇒ nothing (so it
drops cleanly out of the top-level `space-y-10` rhythm).

`offset` shifts every example's page-global index so that stacked components on
one page get disjoint tab-state ranges in a shared `Model`.

{-| A live preview paired with a per-example tab strip that switches its code
between the API surfaces (optionally `M3e`, then the `el` / `build` surfaces, and
always `HTML`). The selection lives in
`model.surfaces` keyed by this example's index, defaulting to the first available
surface (`defaultSurfaceFor`). Grouped as one
`space-y-3` block so title/preview/tabs/code stay tight while sections stay apart.

{-| The 0-based position of the selected `surface` within `surfacesFor ex` — the panel
`slidingPanels` translates into view. Every panel in `surfacesFor ex` is mounted (one
`codeFor` surface each) so the prior panel can slide out as the new one slides in;
this index just drives the track offset. Clamps to 0 if the surface isn't offered
(unreachable — the selection comes from `defaultSurfaceFor`/a tab click, both drawn
from `surfacesFor`).

{-| The per-example surface selector: a single-select `Tabs` bar whose selected
tab is this example's current surface and whose clicks record a `SelectSurface` for
this example's index only. The tabs are dynamic per example (four to six); `Tabs`
paginates/scrolls them horizontally on narrow viewports natively, so there's no
`overflow-x-auto` wrapper — that wrapper forces `overflow-y: auto` (CSS spec) and
trips a spurious vertical scrollbar on the control's state-surface bleed.

{-| The code block for the selected surface. The Elm surfaces highlight as Elm;
the raw `<m3e-*>` HTML surface highlights as plain markup.

`Top` is only offered by `surfacesFor` when its field is present, so its `Nothing`
branch is defensive (falls back to HTML). `Record` and `Build` ARE offered with a
null field — when this example's content had nothing for that surface to lift, the
surface is identical to `M3e` by design, so we show a short rationale instead of a
hollow duplicate.
