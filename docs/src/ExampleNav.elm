module ExampleNav exposing (footer)

{-| The shared footer strip for the `/examples/*` app-screen pages.

Each example is a full-viewport, immersive screen with no docs chrome, so
before this the pages were dead ends: no way back to the component reference
they were built from, and no way to step to the next example. This module adds
a single quiet footer bar that closes both gaps:

  - **Built from** — links to the `/components/:slug` reference page for each
    component the screen composes, so a reader can jump from "this is what it
    looks like assembled" to "here is the API for the piece I want".
  - **prev / next** — links to the neighbouring example, so the five screens
    read as a sequence rather than five separate tabs.

The bar is deliberately low-contrast (`surfaceContainer`, `onSurfaceVariant`)
and sits after the screen content, so it never competes with the example it
annotates.

{-| Render the footer for one example page.

  - `builtFrom` is a list of `( componentSlug, label )` pairs. Each slug must
    match a `/components/:slug` route (i.e. a slug in `data/reference.json`);
    the label is the human-facing component name.
  - `prev` / `next` are `Maybe ( href, label )` for the neighbouring examples;
    `Nothing` renders nothing on that side (first example has no prev, last has
    no next).
