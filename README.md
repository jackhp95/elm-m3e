# elm-m3e · `M3e.*` — type-safe Material 3 Expressive for Elm

A **Make-Impossible-States-Impossible** Elm API over matraic's
[`@m3e/web`](https://github.com/matraic/m3e) Material 3 Expressive web components.
The invariant is the **Material 3 spec + accessibility**, not the DOM: slots are
typed to the kinds M3 allows, accessible-name requirements are lint-enforced (an
`elm-review` rule refuses a nameless icon-only control), and the whole library is
**generated** — you learn two or three components and you know them all, because
they came from the same machine.

> **Accessible names.** Valid *slotting* is a compile-time guarantee. Accessible names are
> a lint-time guarantee: per-component facts mark controls like `iconButton`/`fab` as
> requiring `aria-label`, and the codegen-aware `missingRequiredAttribute` rule refuses a
> nameless control — run `elm-review` in CI to hold it.

> **Status: prerelease, not yet published.** Breaking changes are embraced; the
> priority is correctness and uniformity over back-compat.

## What's in the repo

The repo root (`elm.json` + `src/`) is the package, but the registry package
**exposes only the primitives** (`M3e.Html` + the token/vocab modules). The full
`M3e.*` component surface is generated into `src/` too — present, but unexposed —
so consumers get it by **[ejecting](#components--eject-dont-install)**, not from
the registry. Everything else is generator, docs, and tooling consumers never download.

```
elm.json + src/        THE library. src/ holds the WHOLE generated M3e.* surface
                       (primitives + per-component modules); elm.json exposes only
                       the primitives (docs.json stays under the 700 KB cap), and
                       components are ejected. The IR core (HtmlIr.*) is imported
                       from elm-html-intermediate-representation, NOT emitted here.
config/slots.json      The declarative config that shapes the generated surface
                       (per-slot kinds/multi/required + aria/action/variant groups).
                       Its "_phantom": true switches on the phantom pipeline.
elm-cem/ (sibling)     The library-agnostic generator (the phantom pipeline).
                       Regenerates src/ from the @m3e/web CEM + config.
docs/                  The elm-pages docs site + the design docs (read order below).
docs/kit/              Userland producer kit (copyable, NOT in the package):
                       Kit (text/link), Native (native-HTML IR), Seam.
review/                The codegen-aware elm-review config.
tests/                 IR-core + slot unit tests (self-contained elm-test project).
```

## Install

The Elm registry package `jackhp95/elm-m3e` is the brand's **primitives + tokens** — the
loose, HTML-shaped surface. Install it (plus the shared IR it imports):

```bash
elm install jackhp95/elm-html-intermediate-representation
elm install jackhp95/elm-m3e
```

That gives you the **general layer** — enough to build real (if loosely-typed) UI:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `M3e.Html` | every element in the `elm/html` call shape — `M3e.Html.button [attrs] [content]` |
| `M3e.Attributes` / `M3e.Events` / `M3e.Values` | the shared attribute / event / design-token vocabulary |
| `M3e.Kind` / `M3e.Coerce` / `M3e.Unsafe` / `M3e.Build` | phantom rows, config-blessed brand crossings, the `fromHtml` escape hatch, the shared builder |

The IR core (`HtmlIr.*`) comes from the `elm-html-intermediate-representation`
dependency — **imported, not bundled**.

### Components — eject, don't install

The strict per-component surface (`M3e.Button`, `M3e.Dialog`, … , the `M3e` barrel with
`M3e.button`, the incremental `build` pipeline, full compile-time slot/enum guarantees) is
**too large to publish** — a phantom-typed component library blows the registry's 700 KB
docs cap. Instead you **eject** it into your project as generated source:

```bash
npm install --save-dev elm-cem
npx elm-cem eject m3e --elm-json=elm.json --with-review --write
```

That pulls the full `M3e.*` modules into `vendor/M3e`, adds it to your `source-directories`,
swaps the `elm-m3e` dependency for the deps the generated code needs (IR + facts), pins
`@m3e/web` to the matching version, and (with `--with-review`) wires the codegen-aware
`elm-review` rules. Run it **without** `--write` first to preview every change. Prefer no
Node? Copy `src/` straight from [the repo](https://github.com/jackhp95/elm-m3e) into
`vendor/M3e` and add it to `source-directories` — same result, but pin `@m3e/web` yourself
to the version this repo targets.

Ejecting is a **non-breaking upgrade**: it *adds* the barrel + components on top of the
primitives, so any `M3e.Html.*` / `M3e.Values.*` you already wrote keeps compiling. And the
ejected tree is a **build artifact** — regenerate/re-eject it, never hand-edit it.

> **Prerelease.** Until `1.0.0` is tagged and published, `elm install jackhp95/elm-m3e`
> will not yet resolve; see [`RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`](RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) for the
> owner-only publish steps.

`M3e.*` only produces the **Elm** side — `<m3e-*>` custom-element markup. Those
elements do nothing until the matching JS custom elements are registered. In your
consuming app, install and import the web components once at startup:

```bash
npm install @m3e/web
```

```js
// index.js — register every <m3e-*> element before your Elm app mounts
import "@m3e/web";
import { Elm } from "./Main.elm";

Elm.Main.init({ node: document.getElementById("root") });
```

## The API

One component, **two surfaces** — general and per-component. Both are element↔attr
typed and compiler-checked; the per-component surface adds required-content,
narrowed values, and the incremental `build` pipeline. See
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md):

| | Module | Call | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **general** | `M3e` | `M3e.treeItem [attrs] [content]` — lowercase name, one import | the everyday default |
| **general vocabulary** | `M3e.Attributes` / `M3e.Events` / `M3e.Values` | `M3e.Attributes.open True`, `M3e.Events.onClick …` | shared attribute/event/value setters, library-wide unions |
| **per-component** | `M3e.TreeItem` | `M3e.TreeItem.view [attrs] [content]` | tighter narrowed values + required content, compile-time |
| **per-component build** | `M3e.TreeItem` | `M3e.TreeItem.build { … } \|> M3e.TreeItem.open True \|> …` | the incremental pipeline where a one-only setter can't be written twice |

The two surfaces are peers: the general surface is the `elm/html`-shaped everyday
API; drop to `M3e.<Component>` when you want the compiler (not `elm-review`) to enforce
required content and placed-child slot-kinds. Exactly three checks — missing-required,
duplicate-singular, and slot-kind of a child placed via a slot function — are
`elm-review` guidance on the general surface and compile errors on the per-component
surface; everything else (invalid enum token, wrong attr on an element, wrong-kind
direct child) is a compile error on both. **Start general; reach for `M3e.<Component>`
when you want the tighter guarantees.**

A call returns an `Element` — a lazy, phantom-typed IR node — which collapses to
`Html` exactly once, at the application root, via
`HtmlIr.Element.toNode >> HtmlIr.Node.toHtml`:

```elm
import Html exposing (Html)
import HtmlIr.Element
import HtmlIr.Node
import M3e
import M3e.Icon
import M3e.TreeItem


tree : Html msg
tree =
    M3e.TreeItem.view
        [ M3e.TreeItem.open True ]                          -- attributes (phantom capability row)
        [ M3e.TreeItem.label (M3e.text "Getting Started")   -- a named slot (setter)
        , M3e.TreeItem.icon (M3e.icon [ M3e.Icon.name "folder" ] [])
        , M3e.TreeItem.view [] [ M3e.TreeItem.label (M3e.text "Child") ]
            -- a default-slot child is just the raw Element — no wrapper
        ]
        -- one conversion at the application root turns the typed IR into Html:
        |> HtmlIr.Element.toNode
        |> HtmlIr.Node.toHtml
```

> **`M3e.text` is built in.** The general surface exposes `M3e.text : String -> Element …`
> directly — no userland seam needed for plain text content. For richer producers
> (`link`, `label`, `recast`, raw-`Html` crossings) copy `docs/kit/Seam.elm` + `Kit.elm`
> into your app (copy-paste, not a dependency) — that userland `Seam` is built on
> `HtmlIr.Internal` and is the sanctioned boundary between raw `Html` and the typed IR.

- **Type-level (the MISI that matters):** kind + capability validity via extensible
  phantom rows. A wrong attribute or a wrong-kind slot child is a **compile error**.
- **`arbitrary` slots** accept any element (a plain type variable). `Seam.recast`
  (from `docs/kit/Seam.elm`) is the loud, auditable override when the design system is wrong.
- **Advisory (elm-review):** required-presence, singular cardinality, and slot-kind
  correctness for children placed via a slot function
  (`Cem.ValidSlotKind`, `Lenient` by default / `Strict` opt-in) — see
  [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).
- The IR is for **composition**, not introspection; it renders once at
  `HtmlIr.Node.toHtml`.

## Quickstart

A complete, compiling `Main.elm` that needs **only the published package**
(`elm/browser` + `jackhp95/elm-m3e` + its `elm-html-intermediate-representation`
dependency). `M3e.text` is built in — no userland seam required for plain text:

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html)
import HtmlIr.Element
import HtmlIr.Node
import M3e
import M3e.Button
import M3e.Icon
import M3e.Values as Value


type alias Model =
    { count : Int }


type Msg
    = Clicked


main : Program () Model Msg
main =
    Browser.sandbox
        { init = { count = 0 }
        , update = \Clicked model -> { model | count = model.count + 1 }
        , view = view
        }


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    M3e.button
        [ M3e.Button.variant Value.filled
        , M3e.Button.onClick Clicked
        ]
        [ M3e.text ("Clicked " ++ String.fromInt model.count)
        , M3e.Button.icon (M3e.icon [ M3e.Icon.name "add" ] [])
        ]
        |> HtmlIr.Element.toNode
        |> HtmlIr.Node.toHtml
```

Remember the [wiring note](#install): nothing renders until `@m3e/web` is imported
so the `<m3e-button>`/`<m3e-icon>` custom elements are registered.

## How it's built

`elm-cem` reads the `@m3e/web` **Custom Elements Manifest** plus a **hand-authored
`config/slots.json`** (encoding slot kinds, required attributes, and variant groups the
manifest doesn't carry) and — because that config sets `"_phantom": true` — runs the
**phantom pipeline**: it emits the general surface (`M3e` / `M3e.Attributes` / `M3e.Events`
/ `M3e.Values`) and one strict module per component (`M3e.Button`, …), all **importing**
the shared IR core (`HtmlIr.*`) rather than bundling it. The generator carries **no m3e
opinions** — all m3e specifics live in `config/`.

On a new `@m3e/web` release you **regenerate** — a runbook step you run, not
something that happens on its own (see the `regenerating-elm-m3e` skill). Components
already covered by `config/slots.json` regenerate cleanly; any component the manifest
*adds* that the config doesn't yet cover degrades to loose `arbitrary` slots (and skips
its required-attribute facts) until `config/slots.json` is updated by hand. Because an
uncovered component surfaces as loose `arbitrary` slots in the generated output, that gap
is visible rather than silent.

## Documentation site

The docs are an [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com) app that renders **the real
library modules** (source-dirs point at `src` + `docs/kit`),
styled with Tailwind v4 + the
[`tailwind-m3e-web`](https://github.com/jackhp95/tailwind-m3e-web) bridge.

```bash
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm run build     # -> docs/dist  (CSS is Vite/Tailwind-bundled & content-hashed;
                   #                custom elements are bundled from index.ts)
pnpm start         # local dev server
```

Deploy (Netlify): **Base directory** = `docs`; build/publish come from
`docs/netlify.toml`.

## Testing

The old IR-introspection unit suite was removed — the per-component surface makes those
facts compile-time guarantees. Coverage now lives in four layers:

- **The type system** — a green compile of the `M3e.*` surface proves the *closed-slot*
  invariants: named-slot inputs and kind-restricted default child lists are compile
  errors, as is a wrong enum value or an unadmitted attribute. (Open `arbitrary`-default
  slots accept any element by design — their slot-kind correctness is elm-review
  guidance, not a compile-time fact; see the elm-review layer below.) The library imports
  the not-yet-published `HtmlIr.*` from its sibling checkout, so the full surface is
  compiled in CI two ways: the `elm-review` step (which compiles `../src` through
  `docs/elm.json`) and the docs pipeline's whole-API `elm make --docs`
  (`docs` job → `build:reference`).
- **elm-review rules** — the repo's strongest coverage. One rule is repo-local:
  `NoProprietaryDsClasses` (in [`review/src`](review/src/NoProprietaryDsClasses.elm)),
  with its own [`review/tests/`](review/tests/) suite (7 cases). It runs on top of the
  codegen-aware, facts-driven and seam rules — `ValidEnumValue`, `RequireSlot`,
  `SingularSlot`, `NoSeamOutsideAllowedModules`, `NoInternalImportOutsideAllowed`, … —
  which are sourced from the published
  [`jackhp95/elm-review-cem`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jackhp95/elm-review-cem/latest/)
  package (a normal `elm-review` dependency — see
  [`review/README.md`](review/README.md)). Run with `elm-review --config review`.
- **`Test.Html.Query` runtime suite** — [`tests/`](tests/) holds `DomOutputTest.elm`,
  which renders representative top-layer `M3e.*` compositions through the single eager
  exit and pins the _public_ contract: the right `<m3e-*>` tag, slot stamping,
  attribute/token emission, and authored child order. Run with `npm test` (wraps
  `elm-test --compiler node_modules/.bin/elm` from `tests/`). The IR-core reduction
  tests that used to sit beside it (`IrCoreTest`, `NodeSlotTest` — leaf→`<span>`
  attribute promotion and the #79 named-slot regression) tested the IR substrate, not
  this library, so they now live in
  [`elm-html-intermediate-representation/tests/`](https://github.com/jackhp95/elm-html-intermediate-representation)
  next to the code they pin.
- **Playwright** — [`docs/tests-browser/`](docs/tests-browser/), for the runtime contract
  (shadow DOM, DOM properties, the a11y tree) that only a real browser shows.
